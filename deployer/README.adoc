This project contains an implementation of the Spring Cloud `AppDeployer` SPI, which launches an executable thin jar as a Spring Application in the current JVM, but with an isolated class loader. It is roughly 4 times faster than the canonical "local" `AppDeployer` that launches the same jars as separate processes. (There are integration tests that you can run to verify this.)

Usage:

* Create a https://github.com/dsyer/spring-boot-thin-launcher[thin jar] with a `Start-Class` or unique main class (a class with a main method that is a `@SpringBootApplication`).

* Create a `ThinJarAppDeployer` and use it to deploy the jar.

Example:

```java
ThinJarAppDeployer deployer = new ThinJarAppDeployer();
Resource resource = new FileSystemResource("<path_to>/mythin.jar" + jarName);
AppDefinition definition = new AppDefinition("mythin", Collections.emptyMap());
AppDeploymentRequest request = new AppDeploymentRequest(definition, resource,
		Collections.emptyMap(), Collections.emptyList());
String id = deployer.deploy(request);
```
